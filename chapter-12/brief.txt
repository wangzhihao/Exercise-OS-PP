1. We want to organize the data and make it sequentially read/write. So one head is good for
sequential working, but mutiple heads will be bad.

2. Spindle speed 7200 RPM , thus 1 rotation cost 60 / 7200 * 1000 ms = 8.33 ms
   The Transfer rate (from surface to buffer) is 54 ~ 128 MB/s, and thus 1 rotation
   54 * 8.33 / 1000 ~ 128 * 8.33 / 1000  MB/s data is transfered, which is 0.44982 ~ 1.06624 MB.
   Suppose a sector is 512 bytes, then there are 921 ~ 2184 sectors.  

online report by 2015 modern hdd have 63 sectors per track.  see here http://superuser.com/a/107733
and the sector size is 4KB. see  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_sector

For physical disk geometries the maximal sector number is determined by the low level format of the
disk. However, for disk access with the BIOS of IBM-PC compatible machines, the sector number was
encoded in six bits, resulting in a maximal number of 63=64-1 sectors per track, where 64=26
corresponds to six bits. The maximum 63 is still in use for virtual CHS geometries.

So 63 is a virtual number.


3. Suppose the diameter of spindle is 1cm, and as we know the diameter of disk is 6.3cm.
  So the distance of all tracks is Sum = ( 6.3 - 1 ) / 2 = 2.65cm;

  suppose the data on each track increases linearly from inner track to outer track. then the
average data capacity = (0.44982 + 1.06624) / 2 = 0.75803 MB;
  
  there are 2 platters and each platter has two surfaces, so every side can store 80GB data.
  Then there are 80GB / 0.75803 MB tracks in total, which is approximately 108070;

  Then the distance between two adjacent tracks is 2.65cm / 108070 = 245nm;

online report matches the estimation: 

 A typical magnetic region on a hard-disk platter (as of 2006) is about 200–250 nanometers wide (in
the radial direction of the platter) and extends about 25–30 nanometers in the down-track direction
(the circumferential direction on the platter), corresponding to about 100 billion bits per square
inch of disk area (15.5 Gbit/cm2).

4. We have only one disk arm assembly. So all heads are relatively static and depedent.
